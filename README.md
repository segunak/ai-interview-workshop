## Get Started

Select the **Workshop Agent** in GitHub Copilot Chat (bottom left of the chat input box), then click a question below to start working. Keep the file open while you work so the AI has full context.

## The AI Rule

You can use AI for everything, but you must be able to explain everything your AI produces. Plan first, then prove it with tests. **[Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)**.

1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Generate a plan with your AI tool
3. Review and approve the plan before coding
4. Predict what the code will do before running it
5. Test and prove your solution works
6. Explain your solution, time complexity, tradeoffs, and why it works
