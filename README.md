# AI-Assisted Technical Interview Workshop

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/segunak/ai-interview-workshop?quickstart=1)

Practice technical interviews the way they actually happen in the age of AI, with coding assistants as your partner.

## What Is This?

This workshop teaches you how to use AI tools effectively in technical interviews. You'll work through 5 progressively challenging problems, learning to:

- Plan before you code
- Write tests to prove your solutions work
- Communicate clearly with AI assistants
- Explain your approach to interviewers

## Quick Start

1. Click the **Open in GitHub Codespaces** button above
2. Wait for the environment to load (about 2 minutes)
3. Open the [Workshop Instructions](https://segunak.github.io/ai-interview-workshop/) in a new tab
4. Start with Question 1 in the `question-1-two-sum/` folder

## The 5 Questions

| # | Type | Challenge | Folder |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Data Structures and Algorithms (Easy) | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum) | [question-1-two-sum/](question-1-two-sum/) |
| 2 | Data Structures and Algorithms (Hard) | [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring) | [question-2-minimum-window/](question-2-minimum-window/) |
| 3 | Engineering | Log File Triage | [question-3-log-triage/](question-3-log-triage/) |
| 4 | Engineering | Post to Live Feed | [question-4-live-feed/](question-4-live-feed/) |
| 5 | Engineering | Runway Scheduler | [question-5-runway-scheduler/](question-5-runway-scheduler/) |

## The AI Rule

> **Plan first. Then code and prove it with tests.**

This rule appears on every question. It's the core workflow for AI-assisted development:

1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Generate a plan with your AI tool
3. Review and approve the plan before coding
4. Write tests to verify the solution
5. Be ready to explain how it works

## Tools You Can Use

- [VS Code with GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview) (recommended)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/home)
- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli)

**Not allowed for this workshop:** Browser-based chat tools (ChatGPT web, Claude web, etc.). Practice using AI inside your development environment.
