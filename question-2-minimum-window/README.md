# Question 2: Minimum Window Substring

This folder is for your Minimum Window Substring solution.

## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If no such substring exists, return an empty string.

## Example

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: "BANC" is the smallest substring containing 'A', 'B', and 'C'
```

## Deliverables

1. Working code with your solution
2. Tests that prove it works
3. Be ready to explain your approach

## Reflection

After solving this problem, consider:

- Could you have solved this without AI assistance?
- In real work, does it matter if you "knew the trick" or that you shipped a correct, tested solution?

## AI Rule

> **Plan first. Then code and prove it with tests.**

## Getting Started

This is a hard problem. It's okay to lean on AI heavily here. Focus on understanding the solution and being able to explain it.
