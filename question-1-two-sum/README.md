# Question 1: Two Sum

This folder is for your Two Sum solution.

## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to `target`.

**Constraints:**

- Exactly one solution exists
- You cannot use the same element twice
- Return the indices, not the values

## Example

```txt
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

## Deliverables
