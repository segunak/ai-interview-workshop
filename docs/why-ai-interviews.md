# Why AI Interviews?

If you're wondering why this workshop exists, or if you've encountered skeptics who think using AI in interviews is "cheating," read on.

The short answer: AI isn't going to kill software engineering jobs. It's going to change what they look like. Writing code by hand all day is over. But driving the software development process end to end, shipping something correct, and then maintaining, enhancing, and monitoring it? That's still very much a job. Companies like [Canva](https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/yes-you-can-use-ai-in-our-interviews/) and [Meta](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-ai-job-interview-coding/) already let candidates use AI in technical interviews because they've realized the real skill was never typing code from memory.

This workshop trains you for that reality.

For the full breakdown on why coding (as we've known it) is dead but software engineering is thriving, check out the article I wrote on this topic:
