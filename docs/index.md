## Why AI-Assisted Interviews?

If AI can write code, then the [real skill isn't typing solutions from memory](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/12/11/ai-can-write-your-code-it-cant-do-your-job/). It's driving the software development process end to end and shipping something correct. Companies like [Meta](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-ai-job-interview-coding/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/yes-you-can-use-ai-in-our-interviews/) are adapting interviews to this reality. This workshop trains that modern skill set.

## What You'll Learn

This workshop teaches you how to effectively use AI coding assistants during technical interviews. You'll practice a structured workflow that demonstrates thoughtful problem-solving rather than just generating code.

**The AI Rule:** You can use AI for everything, but you must be able to explain everything your AI produces. Plan first, then prove it with tests. **[Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)**.

## The Workflow

Every problem should follow this sequence:

1. **Ask Clarifying Questions** - Understand the problem before jumping to code
2. **Plan First** - Create a strategy before implementation
3. **Code with Understanding** - Write code (which includes AI generated code, you're responsible for it) you can explain
4. **Write Tests** - Verify your solution works
5. **Explain** - Articulate time complexity, space complexity, and tradeoffs

## Workshop Problems

| Question Number | Problem | Type | Skills Tested |
|---|---------|------|---------------|
| 1 | [Two Sum](question-1-two-sum) | Data Structures and Algorithms | Hash maps, array traversal |
| 2 | [Minimum Window Substring](question-2-minimum-window) | Data Structures and Algorithms | Sliding window, string manipulation |
| 3 | [Log Triage](question-3-log-triage) | Practical Software Engineering | File I/O, parsing, aggregation |
| 4 | [Live Feed POST + Verify](question-4-live-feed) | Practical Software Engineering | HTTP requests, API integration, verification |
| 5 | [Live Feed Form UI](question-5-live-feed-form) | Practical Software Engineering | Frontend, forms, validation, UX |

## Getting Started

Head to the **[Setup](setup)** page to configure your environment, then go to [Question 1](question-1-two-sum) and start practicing!

## Tools Used in This Workshop

- **GitHub Copilot Chat** - Your AI pair programmer (Agent Mode enabled)
- **Python** - Primary language for algorithm problems
- **Node.js** - For JavaScript solutions
- **PowerShell** - For scripting and API calls
- **[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)** - AI in your terminal (Microsoft's answer to Claude Code)
