# AI Interview Workshop

Practice technical interviews using AI coding assistants as your pair programming partner. You may find the accompanying slide deck to this workshop at: [PowerPoint Deck - Times Are Changing: The Rise of AI-Assisted Coding Interviews](https://1drv.ms/p/c/750d396c5cadcebd/IQBsRMeY3HSzRIBxRgHkaxD1AWZG14z_B3al7wfnPaezf4g?e=CjHD76).

## Why AI-Assisted Interviews?

If AI can write code, then the [real skill isn't typing solutions from memory](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/12/11/ai-can-write-your-code-it-cant-do-your-job/). It's driving the software development process end to end and shipping something correct. Companies like [Meta](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-ai-job-interview-coding/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/yes-you-can-use-ai-in-our-interviews/) are adapting interviews to this reality. This workshop trains that modern skill set.

If you think using AI in coding or interviews (where explicitly allowed) is cheating, or that students should focus solely on LeetCode, [read why I disagree](why-ai-interviews).

## What You'll Learn

This workshop teaches you how to effectively use AI coding assistants during technical interviews. You'll practice a structured workflow that demonstrates thoughtful problem-solving rather than just generating code.

**The AI Rule:** You can use AI for everything, but you must be able to explain everything your AI produces. Plan first, then prove it with tests. **[Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)**.

## The Workflow

Every problem should follow this sequence:

1. **Ask Clarifying Questions** - Understand the problem before jumping to code
2. **Plan First** - Create a strategy before implementation
3. **Code with Understanding** - Write code (which includes AI generated code, you're responsible for it) you can explain
4. **Write Tests** - Verify your solution works
5. **Explain** - Articulate time complexity, space complexity, and tradeoffs

## Workshop Problems

## Tools Used in This Workshop

- **GitHub Copilot Chat** - Your AI pair programmer (Agent Mode enabled)
- **Python** - For algorithm solutions (Questions 1-2)
- **PowerShell** - For log triage scripting (Question 3)
- **HTML/CSS/JS** - For API and frontend solutions (Questions 4-5)
- **[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)** - AI in your terminal (Microsoft's answer to Claude Code)
